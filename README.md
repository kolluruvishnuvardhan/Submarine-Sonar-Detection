# Submarine-Sonar-Detection
Sonar-based classification model that detects whether a submarine hit an underwater rock or a mine using acoustic signal data. This project leverages machine learning for accurate prediction and analysis.
## Features  
- Data preprocessing and statistical analysis  
- Train-test split with stratification  
- Logistic Regression model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics including accuracy
## Dataset  
- The dataset consists of **60 features** representing sonar signal intensities at different frequencies.  
- The **61st column** is the target label:  
- **R** (Rock)  
- **M** (Mine)
